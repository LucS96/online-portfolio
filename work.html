Last year I was one of the Presidents of the association in which we participated in more community involvement and student engagement. We also volunteered at Roots2Wings, organized a semi formal event for the University of Windsor Students and had our 3rd annual Down Syndrome Day Walk in which we raised over $800. We also act as a bridge between Disability Studies students and faculty. Currently, I am in my fourth year at the university of Windsor and I am representing the DSSA as our fourth year representative.
