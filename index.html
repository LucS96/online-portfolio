				<p>
					Currently I am in my fourth year at the University of Windsor pursuing a double major in disability studies and psychology. Along with my dedication for learning, I have a passion for working with individuals in the special needs community. Over the past seven years, I have worked in this field and through each experience I have encountered, I have grown in leadership, commitment, and dependability. Throughout my university experience, I have been an active member of the Disability Studies Student Association <abbr title="Disability Studies Student Association">(DSSA)</abbr> in which I took on the role of president in my third year. The DSSA partakes in advocacy for disability studies students, disability awareness, community volunteering, including fundraisers such as the Annual World Down Syndrome Day Walk. Overall, I am a courageous, goal oriented, caring person, who has a passion of working with individuals who have special needs.
